                    The Learning Moon Phases in Virtual Reality is a project in
                    collaboration with the Cornell Physics Department. The goal
                    of the project is to learn how Virtual Reality can be used in
                    a classroom setting and if it is as or more effective than
                    current classroom activities.
                    <br><br>
                    Students are placed above the North Pole and from there they
                    can use the controller to grab and drag the moon around the
                    Earth to showcase how the moon phases change. The student also
                    has the option of viewing the scene from far above the Earth
                    and right on the Earth's surface. Throughout the experience,
                    students are quizzed as they interact with the material.
                    <br><br>
                    As part of the experiment, data from the headset and controllers
                    are recorded from each session. I helped fine-tune the method
                    so that the resulting spreadsheets were easy to find and did
                    not overwrite previous ones. When we got feedback from students
                    that they would prefer to be in some sort of body instead of just
                    floating in space, I prepped and installed an astronaut avatar
                    which then needed adjusting for a good experience. I also
                    helped adapt the environment for multiple people when we decided
                    to add multiplayer support.

                    Merge Critters is a merge idle game where cute critters take
                    up weapons to defend their homeland from a demon invasion.
                    This game was built as a part of MassDiGI's 2019 Summer Innovation
                    Program where mobile games are built from inception to release
                    by a team of student developers.
                    <br><br>
                    As the producer, I lead the team through the process of planning,
                    designing, and implementing of a novel game concept from genre
                    research to release. I facilitated effective communication between
                    team members during meetings and defended my team's decisions to
                    our supervisors. As a programmer, I built key systems in our game
                    as well as installed all of the art assets.

                      Pyret is a programming language designed for teaching people how
                      to code at a high school and introductory collegiate level.
                      Pyret was created because popular programming languages used
                      for teaching today, like Python, have idiosyncrasies that confuse
                      students and hold up their learning. Since the developers created
                      Pyret with teaching in mind, they are able to take the best
                      of Python and add features that they feel it is missing.
                      At the time, Pyret was completely online with a web editor and
                      runtime environment with Google Drive integration.
                      <br><br>
                      As part of Cornell's Open Source Software Engineering course,
                      I and a small team worked with one of the lead developers of the project. They
                      had been getting requests for a version of the editor that
                      would interface with a local file system instead, and had
                      my team look into creating a native desktop application.
                      <br><br>
                      I worked on getting the web version of Pyret to work with
                      Electron, a framework that can take existing web applications
                      and create desktop applications. Once we got the desktop
                      application to work and interface with the local file system,
                      we were given the task to use Travis CI to automatically create
                      and upload new installers every time a branch is pushed to.

                    For Cornell's Software Engineering course, students are broken
                    into small teams and are commissioned by various groups within
                    the University to build something for them. We would then go
                    through an entire agile sprint development process from a
                    feasibility report to final submission.
                    <br><br>
                    My team's client was a professor from the Department of
                    Information Science, Malte Jung. He was studying how humans
                    collaborate when there is a third, robot, agent interceding.
                    His original design included two students and a robotic arm
                    building a tower out of Jenga blocks. The robot would give
                    the students the blocks in turn. However, sometimes the algorithm
                    for the handing out wasn't strictly alternating between the students;
                    sometimes, it was random or favoring one student over another.
                    <br><br>
                    Our project was to create a research platform to extend his
                    original design to work over the internet. However, instead
                    of building a tower, he wanted us to build a collaborative
                    Tetris game, where the robot agent chooses who has control
                    over the next block placement.
                    <br><br>
                    I headed my team's UI subcommittee and led my team through a
                    user-centered design process. We worked with a student in design
                    our client brought in to mock up a wireframe, which I then turned
                    into a paper prototype that everyone in my group could print out
                    and test with potential users. Once we received feedback on the
                    initial design, we then created a high-fidelity prototype.
                    Once we went through another round of user testing, we incorporated
                    the feedback we received into the final application.

                    ARtLens aims to elevate current augmented reality museum tours
                    that are on phones or tablets by utilizing the Microsoft HoloLens.
                    With a headset, patrons are able to look at the exhibits instead
                    of a screen and have their hands free to interact with the
                    extra content in a way not possible with a phone or tablet. This
                    project was built in collaboration with the Davis Museum at
                    Wellesley College.
                    <br><br>
                    I worked on the initial design and testing of the application.
                    We wanted to use "hotspots" - places in space that the HoloLens
                    would recognize and then bring up the content for that particular place.
                    In this case, we wanted certain art pieces to be the hotspots
                    so that a user could walk up to one and the HoloLens would
                    recognize which one it was without an anchor image.
                    <br><br>
                    Since this was a feature we weren't familiar with and documentation
                    at the time was sparse, I worked on testing and finding limitations
                    that would need to be taken into account when building the application
                    to work with the exhibit at the Davis.

                    EyeSee360 is a visualization system designed to map out-of-view
                    objects in an intuitive way for augmented reality. The system
                    presents a coordinate plane that represents the full world around
                    the user as a heads-up display. Important items are mapped onto
                    that plane in relation to where they are compared to the user.
                    The part of the plane that represents the user's field of vision
                    is left blank.
                    <br><br>
                    I was able to work on this project for a summer in Germany as part
                    of a National Science Foundation International Research Experiences
                    for Students program. EyeSee had already been built for the Google
                    Cardboard, however, with visual see-through augmented reality
                    systems, there can be video lag that can cause motion sickness,
                    as well with the nature of the headset blocking a large part
                    of the peripheral vision of the user.
                    <br><br>
                    Once I learned how to use Unity, my job was to port the Google
                    Cardboard version to the Microsoft HoloLens. When I finished,
                    I built compression functions in an effort to maximize the clear
                    space in EyeSee's UI without compromising the effectiveness of
                    the visualization. As the final part of my involvement, I built
                    the beginnings of a game that utilized EyeSee360. The goal was
                    to eventually release it onto the HoloLens store to gather data
                    on the effectiveness of the visualization.
